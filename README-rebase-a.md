# Rebase Exercise (Branch rebase-a)

Instructions:
1. Checkout `rebase-b`: `git checkout rebase-b`
2. Try to rebase it onto `rebase-a`: `git rebase rebase-a`
3. You should see a conflict in `rebase.txt` because both branches edited the same line differently.
4. Resolve the conflict manually, then continue with `git rebase --continue`.
